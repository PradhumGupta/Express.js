1. Basic API Development:

    Create an API to manage a list of students with attributes id, name, age, and class.

2. Validation:

    Add validation to ensure that age is a number and name is not empty in the students' API.

3. Advanced Task:

    Create an API for a todo list application with the following rules:
        task (string, required, at least 3 characters).
        status (boolean, defaults to false if not provided).
        deadline (valid date).

    Enhance validation by ensuring that:
        status must be either true or false.
        deadline must be a valid future date.
