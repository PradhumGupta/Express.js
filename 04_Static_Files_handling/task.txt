1. Basic Static File Setup:
    Create a public folder with:
        index.html: A simple homepage.
        style.css: Some basic styles.
        app.js: A simple JavaScript file with console.log.

2. Virtual Path:
    Serve files under /static instead of the root path.

3. Multiple Directories:
    Create another folder, assets, and add some files. Serve it alongside public.

4. Caching:
    Configure caching for your static files and test it using browser developer tools.

5. Dynamic Data Injection:
    Serve an HTML file using sendFile() and include a route to inject a username dynamically (e.g., Welcome, John!).
